# Crab News

Crab News is a work in progress multi-platform RSS client for desktop and mobile
written in Rust. It is a _itch to scratch_ for fun kind of application.

This is my first attempt at a real [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) application,
to internalize Rust concepts with practice.

## Is it stable?

One day it could be a fully fledged app. In the meantime keep relying on your
favorite client. Don't hold your breath.
