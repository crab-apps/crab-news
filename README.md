# Crab News

Crab News is a work in progress multi-platform RSS client for desktop and mobile
written in Rust.

## State of the Art

This is my first attempt at a real [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) application. I
love to code to internalize a programming language concepts with practice.

## Is it stable?

One day it could be a fully fledged app. In the meantime keep relying on your
favorite client.

### Alternatives

- Apple: [https://netnewswire.com/](https://netnewswire.com/)
- GNOME: [https://apps.gnome.org/NewsFlash/](https://apps.gnome.org/NewsFlash/)

## Why an RSS reader?

[Awesome Rust](https://awesome-rust.com) doesn't have a RSS reader listed. I
would love to contribute one that I'd use every day. Also, sounds like a great
project to both make and learn a lot from.

## Made With
